Let's get a definition of the 2 coolest words
===================================================

- **startup** is a company, a partnership or temporary organisation designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model
    - **tech-startup** does things relating to microelectronics or anything related to electronics, or digital products such as websites, phone apps, software, cloud services, ...
- **entrepreneur**:  ...... buff.... Several people have given different definitions, so I've taken those:
	- who organizes or operates his/her business or businesses
	- who takes initiative, accept risk of failure
	- who understands their own strengths and weakness

How I see this trending
=======================

There has always been people creating business, however in past the most of the times the most of them were small business to create a way to work in something where people could have their own decisions and get the chance to get more money than in a current job.
**Today**, we find the **opposite**.

Internet have so much influence on them, you can open your business to big amount of customer inside and outside the borders, however the competition is huge.

Due the amount, today entrepreneurs has created their **ecosystems**, which provide help and motivation.

They are used to be **more transparent** than big corporates.

.. note::
  Always business
  Internet has changed the things
  Ecosystem

    - Provided by others and for that purpose moreover of becoming a new businesses: Co-working spaces, Accelerators, Incubators

    - Indirected and community: Ecosystem, Internet, Crowd funding, Startups providing affordable services, Open source

Frist one

**One founder** and **nobody else**

I joined as Software Engineer, Developer, DevOps, .... too long, so let's simplify

"The guy" who has to create the product and do whatever the product needs to run

**Two founders** and a bunch of guys, they deserve that I call them "A TEAM"
