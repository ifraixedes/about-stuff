Let's get a definition of the 2 coolest words
===================================================

- **startup** is a company, a partnership or temporary organisation designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model
    - **tech-startup** does things relating to microelectronics or anything related to electronics, or digital products such as websites, phone apps, software, cloud services, ...
- **entrepreneur**:  ...... buff.... Several people have given different definitions, so I've taken those:
	- who organizes or operates his/her business or businesses
	- who takes initiative, accept risk of failure
	- who understands their own strengths and weakness

What is my perception
=======================

The most of the tech-startups are quite ambitious

Internet have so much influence on them, you can open your business to big amount of customer inside and outside the borders, however the competition is huge.

Due the amount, today entrepreneurs has created their **ecosystems**, which provide help and motivation.

They are used to be **more transparent** than big corporates.

.. note::
  Differences between old entrepreneurs and today ones
  Internet has changed the things
  Ecosystem

    - Provided by others and for that purpose moreover of becoming a new businesses: Co-working spaces, Accelerators, Incubators

    - Indirected and community: Ecosystem, Internet, Crowd funding, Startups providing affordable services, Open source
