## Let's get some of the coolest trending definitions
- __startup__: is a company, a partnership or temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model
    - __tech-startup__:  does things relating to microelectronics or anything related to electronics, or digital products such as websites, phone apps, software, cloud services, ...
- __entrepreneur__:  ...... buff.... Several people have given different definitions, so I've taken those:
	- who organizes or operates his/her business or businesses
	- who takes initiative, accept risk of failure
	-  who understands their own strengths and weakness
